## üîç Use Case Descriptions

### Use Case 1: Outlier Removal
Removes the top and bottom 5% of values from the feature `Thickness A+B (mm)` in both training and development sets.

**Goal**: Evaluate model behavior on "normal range" data, excluding extreme values.

---

### Use Case 2: Break Feature Correlation
Randomly shuffles the values of `Current (A)` in the training set to destroy correlation with other features.

**Goal**: Test model robustness against broken feature dependencies or spurious correlations.

---

### Use Case 3: Inject Missing Values
Introduces 10% missing values into the `Force (N)` feature of the training set.

**Goal**: Evaluate the model‚Äôs ability to handle incomplete or noisy data.

---

### Use Case 4: Unseen Category in Evaluation
Removes the `"Explode"` category from the training set and places it exclusively in the development set.

**Goal**: Simulate real-world scenarios where the model encounters a category it was not trained on.

## üß™ How to Use

1. Load the desired `train_data.csv` and `dev_data.csv` from any `use_case_X` folder.
2. Train your model on `train_data.csv`.
3. Evaluate the model using the corresponding `dev_data.csv`.
4. Compare performance across different use cases to assess model robustness.
